# BEACONS MAP/TABLE WEBCOMPONENT

The following web-component exposes the data collected and maintained for the "[BEACON SÃœDTIROL - ALTO ADIGE](https://beacon.bz.it)" project coupled together with the tourism data from "[OPENDATHUB](https://tourism.opendatahub.bz.it)".

## Overview

The web-components in this project are built on top of [Polymer's LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org) and other UI elements and framework ([Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), [OpenstreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [VAADIN Components](https://vaadin.com/components)). The project is organised and managed by [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com), the build process is powered mainly by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

The `beacons-map-table` web-component shows all beacon devices, using a map or a table view, deployed in the region and can optionally associate them to the nearest point-of-interest.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

In order to work on the project, you'll just need a recent and working installation of Node and NPM, the rest of the tools will be installed automatically in the project's scope.

### Setup

This step is required and will install all required software and tools in the project folder. This needs to be run just once and must be repeated in case of relevant changes to the overall project structure.

    bin/setup.sh

### Building

Building the project will yield the distributable components in the `dist` folder, namely `beacons-map-table.min.js`.

    bin/build.sh

### Preview

The built components can be previewed and evaluated using a built-in server at the address [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000).

    bin/serve.sh

## Usage

You can download the packaged/build components and include them in your website or link the resources directly by means of a CDN service.

    <!-- include self-hosted component -->
    <script src="./js/beacons-map-table.min.js"></script>

    <!-- include from CDN -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/noi-techpark/webcomp-beacons-map-table/dist/beacons-map-table.min.js"></script>

Once the component is correctly included, the following custom tag can be used

    <beacons-map-table view="map" search />

### Attributes

#### view

The view attribute can take the following values: `all` (default), `map`, `table` and determines how with which view the beacons are shown.

#### search

This boolean attribute determines if the search functionality should be enabled or not (default).

#### tourism-pois

This boolean attribute determines if the integration with Opendatahub's Tourism data should be enabled or not (default).
